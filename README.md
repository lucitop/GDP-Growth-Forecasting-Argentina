# GDP Growth Forecasting in Argentina



## Project Overview
This project comes as a part of my journey in data science and machine learning, focusing on predicting Argentina's GDP growth. This is to be done using various regression techniques and navigating through unexplored areas. In every step, I continue hoping to solidify my knowledge while feeding it with new concepts that I learn.
The repository makes sure my work will be well organized and easily accessible.

## Models
- **First Model**: Linear Regression

## Data
The data used by all the models is stored in the csv "argentina_macro_data.csv" and the cleaning process (interpolation, DataFrames, etc.) can be seen in the "01_data_preprocessing.ipynb" notebook.

The data used for this project includes:
- GDP (constant 2015 US$) [Billions]
- Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)
- Unemployment, total (total labor force %) (modeled ILO estimate)
- Real interest rate (%)
- Central government debt, total (GDP %)
- General government final consumption expenditure (GDP %)
- Exports of goods and services (GDP %)
- Imports of goods and services (GDP %)
- Population growth (annual %)
- Industry (including construction), value added (GDP %)
- Foreign direct investment, net inflows (GDP %)
- Real effective exchange rate index (2020 = 100)

The data was sourced from:
- World Economic Outlook Databases of the International Monetary Fund.
- Ministerio de Hacienda, Argentina.
- Bank for International Settlements.
- World Bank Group.
